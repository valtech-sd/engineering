What would you do with the ability to tell your customers how many people were in your store, warehouse or clinic at any given moment? How about providing the precise waiting times to get into your supermarket, bank, pharmacy or restaurant in real-time? What if you could protect employees, prevent overcrowding and still deliver an amazing customer experience in a time of uncertainty?

With a mobile app and an indoor positioning system, which many facilities already have installed through their telecom provider, this is doable. And we have built a prototype that proves that it works.
