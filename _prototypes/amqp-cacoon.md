date: 2020-08-01
description: "This is a basic library to provide amqp support. Originally, this library was a wrapper around amqplib. It has since been updated to work with node-amqp-connection-manager, which provides support for behind-the-scenes retries on network failure. Node-amqp-connection-manager guarantees receipt of published messages and provides wrappers around potentially non-persistent channels."
