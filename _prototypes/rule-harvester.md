description: "Rule Harvester is a general purpose rules engine. It processes rule definitions and allows for a highly configurable rules engine with custom inputs and outpus. This package makes heavy use of Rules.Js. We have a desire to use some specific patterns and as a result we have decided to build our own rule harvester based off of Rules.Js."
