        <p class="subtitle"><strong>What is a Battery Pack? .. </strong></p>

        <p>well.. It&lsquo;s a pack of batteries! A pack is made of a number of smaller battery cells all stacked in a
        specific way to deliver the required power that your ebike system needs to function. You must pick the right
        pack, for your application!</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Volts and Amps: </strong></p>
        <p>Without going into too much confusing detail, Voltage is what pushes ( speed ) the flow of electric energy,
        while Amps is a measure of Force. Typically, higher Voltage electric bikes go faster, while higher Amps require
        thicker gauge wires and/or more powerful and larger battery packs. Combination of Volts and Amps equal Watts.
        </p>

        <p>Ok, time to crunch some numbers and get down to the nitty gritty of it. All batteries and battery packs will
        have fine print, listing various things of high importance, put on the bifocals and squint, expect to find
        things like :</p>

        <p><strong>Volts: </strong>Used to describe how fast electrons move, more voltage = more speed !</p>

        <p><strong>Amps: </strong>How wide the road is, more lanes, more cars can pass at the same time side by side...</p>

        <p><strong>Watts: </strong>The combination of Volts and Amps ( Volts X Amps = Watts )</p>

        <p><strong>Amp Hours: </strong>Should always be listed, typically 10 to 20 Amp Hours ( abbreviated " Ah " ) a measure of how many
        fixed number of Amps a battery can sustain for 1 hour.. ( C rate ). Or, double the amps for half the time.. Or
        half the amps for two hours.. etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Hours: </strong>This is a far more accurate way to know how much usable energy is in a given battery pack (
        abbreviated Wh ) when available, this is the number to look for! Also, you can translate it into how many watts,
        continuous, for 1 hour! A 500wh battery can deliver 500 watts for 1 hour or 1000w for 30 minutes.... or 250w for
        2 hours .. etc.. Most ebikes do not use power at an exact level, continuously, so this does not directly
        translate into ride time, but you can quickly see how a larger battery with more energy (capacity) can deliver
        lower power levels for longer periods of time, and go further on a charge.</p>
