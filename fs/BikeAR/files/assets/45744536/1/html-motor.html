      <p class="subtitle"><strong>Which motor is best? .. </strong></p>
      
      <p>
        If you’re looking for a quick and simple answer as to which is the
        best motor, we have to disappoint you now: there’s no longer just one
        best motor. With the latest developments in ebike motors and batteries
        there are lots of systems suitable for different ebike concepts and
        rider demands. It’s for this reason you can no longer ask which is the
        best motor, but rather have to think about which is the most suitable
        system for you.

        <strong>How much power do you really need?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s critical to note that the best motor can only ever be as good as
        the bike into which it’s built. As well as that, the motor has to be
        considered in relation to the battery capacity. There’s no use having
        the most powerful motor if you’ve got to ride your bike in Eco mode
        just to be able to reach your destination.<br /><br />
        Ultimately, it’s a question of personal preference. How much or how
        little power do you really want (or need)?
