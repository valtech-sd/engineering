    <p class="subtitle"><strong>Class 1: Pedal Assist / Pedelec</strong></p>

    <p>
        The most common type of electric bike is the pedal assist or pedelec.
        The rider pedals the bike normally while a motor provides assistance,
        increasing the power transmitted to the rear wheel. The pedaling takes far less effort than it normally would,
        even in high gears, which allows for higher speeds and effortless climbing over steep hills.
        Settings can control the amount of assistance the rider desires but to be considered a Class 1 e-bike in most of
        Europe,
        the system cannot provide assistance over 25 kilometers per hour (kph) or approximately 15 miles per hour.
        In the US this class is limited to approximately 32 kph or 20 mph.
        A class 1 designation allows these bike to be used on most roads and paths
        where normal bikes are allowed and do not require any additional licensing.

        <strong>Class 2: Throttle</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Much like a motorcycle or scooter, a throttle operated e-bike propels the bike forward
        without any additional pedaling from the rider. Most can provide a variable amount of power
        depending how far the throttle is pushed. These are much less common than their pedal assist
        counterparts as many countries have laws that prohibit them entirely.
        The European Union requires an e-bike only provide power while the pedals are moving forward,
        so throttle e-bike are most common in the United States and China where little legislation exists to limit their
        use.

        <strong>Class 3: Speed Pedelec</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The design of a speed pedelec is similar to a standard pedelec but as the name implies,
        they allow for a higher top speed of 45 kph or approximately 28 mph . In many areas
        this class of e-bike is considered a motor vehicle requires its riders to be licensed.
